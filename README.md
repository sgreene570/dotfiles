# nvim
My vimrc(init.vim for nvim) has a few standard settings and a couple of easter eggs.

Tabs are set to 4 spaces, because that's how I like it.

F5 can be mashed to kill off trailing whitspaces.

# bashrc
Not much to say here, got some nice colors and some basic aliases.

(I try to avoid using aliases when possible, they feel like a crutch sometimes).

Also, I prefer a higher key repeat rate, especially with nvim.

# bash_profile
Starts x automatically on login.

# bindings.sh
This is a bash script I wrote to map out a few keys for xbindkeys.

This script prompts users to bind the volume up and down keys through ALSA, as well as the brightness up and down keys through xbacklight.

Typically, I add other things to my .xbindkeysrc such as a binding for slock (usually <code>mod4 + l</code>).

# openbox
My openbox xml config (rc.xml) and my autostart file live here.

# inputrc
Tab completion ignroing case is a must, and so is disabling the dang terminal bell.

# Xresources
This is where I set my default terminal font and font size.
