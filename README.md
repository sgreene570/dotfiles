# Vimrc
<br>
My vimrc has a few standard settings and a few neat ones.  
<br>
Tabs are set to 4 spaces, because that's how I like it.
<br>
:W can be used to write a file as sudo (this is pretty useful).
<br>
F5 can be mashed to kill off trailing whitspaces.
<br>
If you plan on keeping the vimrc in the .vim folder, you should make a symlink back in your homedir.
# Bashrc
<br>
Not much to say here, got some nice colors and some basic alisaes.
<br>
(I try to avoid using aliases as a crutch).
<br>
# Bash_profile
<br>
This prompts users on login if they would like to startx.
<br>
Default case is yes.
<br>
# bindings.sh
<br>
This is a bash script I wrote to map out a few keys for xbindkeys.
<br>
This script prompts users to bind the volume up and down keys through ALSA, as well as the brightness up and down keys through xbacklight.
<br>
Typically, I add other things to my .xbindkeysrc such as a binding for slock (usually mod4 + l).
