# dotfiles
My Linux dotfiles
<br>
# nvim
My vimrc(init.vim for neovim) has a few standard settings and a couple of easter eggs.
<br>
Tabs are set to 4 spaces, because that's how I like it.
<br>
F5 can be mashed to kill off trailing whitspaces.
<br>
# bashrc
Not much to say here, got some nice colors and some basic aliases.
<br>
(I try to avoid using aliases as a crutch, and maybe you should too).
<br>
However, I do alias a few things, including neovim to vim.
Also, I prefer a higher key repeat rate, especially when using in nvim.
<br>
# bash_profile
Starts x automatically on login.
<br>
# bindings.sh
This is a bash script I wrote to map out a few keys for xbindkeys.
<br>
This script prompts users to bind the volume up and down keys through ALSA, as well as the brightness up and down keys through xbacklight.
<br>
Typically, I add other things to my .xbindkeysrc such as a binding for slock (usually <code>mod4 + l</code>).
<br>
# openbox
My openbox xml config (rc.xml) and my autostart file live here.
<br>
Has a list of generic programs that I need to launch when openbox starts.
<br>
<br>
# inputrc
Tab completion ignroing case is a must, and so is disabling that pesky bell sound.
