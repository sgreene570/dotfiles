# nvim
My vimrc(init.vim for nvim) has a few standard settings and a couple of easter eggs.
<br>
Tabs are set to 4 spaces, because that's how I like it.
<br>
F5 can be mashed to kill off trailing whitspaces.
<br>
# bashrc
Not much to say here, got some nice colors and some basic aliases.
<br>
(I try to avoid using aliases when possible, they feel like a crutch sometimes).
<br>
Also, I prefer a higher key repeat rate, especially with nvim.
<br>
# bash_profile
Starts x automatically on login.
<br>
# bindings.sh
This is a bash script I wrote to map out a few keys for xbindkeys.
<br>
This script prompts users to bind the volume up and down keys through ALSA, as well as the brightness up and down keys through xbacklight.
<br>
Typically, I add other things to my .xbindkeysrc such as a binding for slock (usually <code>mod4 + l</code>).
<br>
# openbox
My openbox xml config (rc.xml) and my autostart file live here.
<br>
# inputrc
Tab completion ignroing case is a must, and so is disabling terminal bells.
